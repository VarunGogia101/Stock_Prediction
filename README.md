This project is to apply machine learning in one of the most challenging areas in finance: price
prediction. In the course of the project, you will get familiar with (1) the procedure of machine learning
prediction on time series; (2) extracting informative features and constructing useful labels; (3) selecting
features and classifiers to optimize the performance and optionally (4) building an algorithmic trading
strategy based on machine learning.

Data-
We focus on the S&P stock universe and use daily price data.
